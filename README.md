# 🛠️ How it Works

- 🧠 Recommendation Models

    - # Collaborative Filtering #:
       Uses user-item matrices and matrix factorization (SVD/NMF) to find similar users/items.
      
    - # Content-Based Filtering #:
       Leverages movie genres, titles, and years using TF-IDF and similarity scoring.
 
    - # Hybrid Model #:
       Combines collaborative and content-based scores using weighted or switching strategy.
